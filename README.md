# Scientific-Statistical-Questions

This repository contains a notebook (in both .ipynb form as well as .html for ease of reading) which features and in-depth walkthrough of the scientific process of going from a statistical question to a mathematical expression to an algorithmic solution. It begins by using a simple simulated example, with no unknowns, then transitions to a real world astronomical example of scientific data analysis.
